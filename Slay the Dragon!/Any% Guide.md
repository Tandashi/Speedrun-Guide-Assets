# Comprehensive Guide - Any% 

## Foreword

This is a full guide on how to run the any%-category in its current state.
In this guide we assume that the game is played using a controller. (Important for key-inputs for skips)

## Legend

## Route

### Intro

Directly when the run starts and the game loading symbol isn't showing anymore you will press <kbd>Start / ▶</kbd> on your controller.
This will skip the complete intro cutscene. 

#### Pitfalls

Some pitfalls with this skip can occur:

1. The intro cutscene isn't skipping no matter how often you press <kbd>Start / ▶</kbd> on your controller. This occurs when you press <kbd>Start / ▶</kbd> too early aka. you pressed when the loading symbol was still showing. Try pressing a bit later.

### Autumn Fields

Once you finished the intro and loaded into Autumn Fields head right to the place where you get the sword.
The optimal path is displayed here:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Route/Autumn_Fields_1.png)

1. You start here
2. You need to roll here to get through. Experiment a bit to get the timing right to go through smoothly.

3. Perform a sword skip here. (Detailed information on this skip can be found under the "Skip and Strategies"-section)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Route/Autumn_Fields_3.png)

4. Loading-Zone trigger to get to Forest Mountains

### Forest Mountain

Forest Mountain is pretty straight forward pathing wise. All you have to do is just walk straight with a skip and a fight somewhere down the line.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Route/ForestMountain_1.png)

5. You start here in Forest Mountain

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Route/ForestMountain_2.png)

6. Here you have to perform the rope skip. (Detailed information on this skip can be found under the "Skip and Strategies"-section)
7. Here you have to perform a cutscene "skip" to get control over your character back early. (Detailed information on this skip can be found under the "Skip and Strategies"-section)

8. Here you can perform a cutscene "skip" and get control back early to hit the golem faster. (Detailed information on this skip can be found under the "Skip and Strategies"-section)
   No really good strategy has been found yet to fight the ice golems other then not getting hit and delaying the death of the first one as long as possible to reduce the second phase.

### Dragons Lair

Dragons Lair is pretty straight forward routing wise as well. Just follow the path till the final boss fight really.

10. The cutscene trigger for the final boss fight

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Route/Dragons_Lair_4.png)

11. Here you can perform a cutscene "skip" and get control back early to get closer to the dragon. Once the second cutscene starts you can do the cutscene skip again to get even closer to the dragon and even damage it early. (Detailed information on this skip can be found under the "Skip and Strategies"-section)
    A very easy strategy has been found to fight the Dragon.  (Detailed information on this strategy can be found under the "Skip and Strategies"-section)

### Backyard

Basically just walk to the finish line here

## Skips and Strategies

### Sword Skip / Chestnut Skip

Found by: [Sliebum](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Sliebum)

To start the sword skip / chestnut skip you need to position yourself like this while still holding the directional input <kbd>↗</kbd>:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Skips/Sword%20Skip/Positioning.jpg)

If you are positioned correctly your character should walk against a wall and not glide away. Now press <kbd>A</kbd> to perform a roll. While the character is still rolling press <kbd>B</kbd> to pick up the sword. Now your character should be inside the wall. Move <kbd>↓</kbd> down straight and should pop out of the wall.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Skips/Sword%20Skip/Result.jpg)

From here just continue to move straight down until you fall off the tree.

### Rope Skip

Found by: [Sliebum](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Sliebum)
Alternative by: [TheMaZei](https://www.speedrun.com/user/TheMaZei) (Slower than optimal route)

To start the rope skip position yourself like this:![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Skips/Rope%20Skip/Positioning.jpg)

Now perform a roll so you get onto the pole and the rope. From there move along the rope by holding the directional input <kbd>↖ / ↑</kbd> until your character stops.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Skips/Rope%20Skip/Mid_1.jpg)

Here you have to perform a roll by pressing <kbd>A</kbd> while still holding the directional input <kbd>↖ / ↑</kbd>. Do this multiple times until you've reached this position.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Skips/Rope%20Skip/Mid_2.jpg)

Swing around the pole with a roll (<kbd>A</kbd>) to reach the plank wall

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Skips/Rope%20Skip/Mid_3.jpg)

Hold the directional input against the plank wall and start rolling  (<kbd>A</kbd>)  against it in slow intervals. You have to wait till the roll animation finishes to continue climbing so spamming roll (<kbd>A</kbd>) will do nothing and will probably even loose you some time. It can also be that you have to adjust the directional input a bit to continue climbing again.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Skips/Rope%20Skip/Mid_4.jpg)

Once at the top of the plank wall roll over to the other side but be careful. If you fall into the water you are soft-locked and can start all over.
If you've done everything correctly your character should now be on the other side.

### Cutscene "Skip"

Found by: [Sliebum](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Sliebum)

To perform a cutscene "skip" and gaining control over the character back early all you have to do is pause during a cutscene and resume the game.

#### Pitfalls

1. If you pause during a cutscene while the character is still moving / pathfinding and resume the game the animation controller of you character will start to freak out and you semi-soft-locked the game resulting in a reset. In this state however you animations are instant ;)

### Dragon Strategy

Found by: [TheMaZei](https://www.speedrun.com/user/TheMaZei)

Once the Dragon fight starts just get him to 3/4 of his HP so he starts summoning his little minions. This is the time when you move as follows

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tandashi/Speedrun-Guide-Assets/master/Slay%20the%20Dragon!/Any%25/Strategies/Dragon/Result.png)

You can move between the crystals to go up to the Dragons resting place and hit him there until he is dead. Be careful though as the meteoroids can still hit you here if you are unlucky. Just dodge them.
